My proposal “Pricing Mechanism and Risk Spillover Effects of Platform Tokens in the Digital Economy” (Grant No. 72503258) received funding from the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Over 2026–2028 we will build open datasets tracing how token incentives propagate to traditional markets and regulatory decisions.
