Hello! I am Weiyi Zhao (赵魏一), an Assistant Professor at the School of Finance, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law (ZUEL). I am also an external member of Cornell’s Digital Economics and Financial Technology (DEFT) Lab. My research spans empirical asset pricing, digital platforms, tokenomics, and AI in finance. I am particularly interested in how digital assets, blockchain technologies, and emerging AI tools are reshaping modern financial markets.

I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Tsinghua University and a B.Econ. in Financial Engineering from Wuhan University. My recent work studies how crypto assets price risk, how network effects shape platform outcomes, and how AI methods can uncover new return predictors in financial markets.

If you are interested in collaborations on tokenomics, AI in finance, or platform regulation, please feel free to reach out.
