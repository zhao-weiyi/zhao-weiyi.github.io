Hello! I am Weiyi Zhao (赵魏一), an Assistant Professor of Finance at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law and an external member of Cornell’s Digital Economy and Financial Technology (DEFT) Lab. My research spans empirical asset pricing, digital platforms, and the economics of token-based ecosystems, combining institutional detail with large-scale data and machine learning.

I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Tsinghua University and a B.Econ. in Financial Engineering from Wuhan University. My recent work studies how crypto assets price risk, how platform regulations shape innovation, and how AI tools can surface new factors in financial markets. These projects have received multiple best paper awards across EFMA, CBER, Tel Aviv University’s Blockchain Research Institute, and China’s Tech-Fin Research Conference.

Before joining ZUEL, I taught Intermediate Macroeconomics at Tsinghua’s School of Social Sciences and supported Advanced Microeconomics II and Law and Economics courses at Tsinghua SEM. At ZUEL I am launching a new graduate course on Machine Learning and Quantitative Investment.

I regularly present at the Econometric Society World Congress, FMA, ABFER, and cryptocurrency-focused conferences. I am also a PI on National Natural Science Foundation of China and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation grants investigating the pricing and risk spillovers of platform tokens.

If you are interested in collaborations on tokenomics, platform regulation, or AI for asset pricing, feel free to reach out.
