Working as an external member of Cornell DEFT Lab, I co-lead projects on marketplace lending, asymmetric cross-side network effects, and crypto market segmentation. The collaboration blends Cornell’s empirical infrastructure with field partnerships in Asia to test theoretical predictions.

Focus areas:
- Marketplace lending platform design and pricing efficiency
- Token issuance policy and cross-border regulatory sandboxes
- Machine-learning diagnostics for systemic risk on digital platforms

Representative outputs include the paper “Asymmetric Cross-side Network Effects on Financial Platforms” (NBER, 2024) and ongoing experiments measuring regulatory sandbox effects on FinTech financing.
